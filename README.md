# Impact of Electric Vehicle Adoption in California

This project explores how the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) in California relates to changes in **air pollution** and **electricity demand**. We analyze EV registration trends, PM2.5 air quality data, and statewide power usage to understand environmental impact.

## My Contributions

* Led data cleaning and preprocessing, including formatting and merging datasets across counties and CBSA regions.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine relationships between EV adoption, PM2.5 air quality levels, and electricity consumption.
* Designed and produced visualizations (time series plots, comparative regional trends, and correlation graphs) used in the final analysis and presentation.
* Helped interpret statistical outputs and connect results back to environmental and policy implications.
* Edited, assembled, and published the project video, including narrative structure, visuals, pacing, and final upload.
* Contributed to writing and revising the final notebook, ensuring clarity, flow, and reproducibility of the methodology.

## Key Findings

* Regions with higher EV adoption generally show **lower PM2.5 pollution** over time.
* **Electricity usage has increased**, but the rise is gradual and currently manageable.
* EV benefits are most noticeable in **urban and high-traffic** regions.

## Data Sources

* CBSA to County Crosswalk (NBER)
* California Vehicle Registration Records
